# Dota2-Accepter

note{

	. version 1.0
	
	. This project is created to automatic accept Dota 2 (finding match)
	
	. no Warranty or any responsibilty
	
	. just created for another players that like automat accept match find when they are AFK
	
}

Requiers:

	1. C++ compiler (here used msvc 2017 x64 and x32)
	
	2. Qt libraries (download Qt and compile it or just install Qt Creator IDE)
	
	3. OpenCV Libraries build (.dll files or .lib files)
	


for 1 and 2 i suggest Qt Creator is nice.


what I did for this project: 

	1. Compiled and build OpenCV libraries for MSVC 2017 
	
	2. used openCV libraries in .pro file
	
	
	
which IDE I used?

	Qt Creator. 
	
	
what's main algorithm to automatic accept?

	- by Opencv we find that accept Button and when we found it 
	
	- we will use windows api to simulate 
	
	- left Click on mouse and Enter key on keyboard(only for ensuring accepted)
	
	
which Algorithms from openCv used?

	-Template Matching
